Digitalised cutting sheets are constructed as follows (containing 8 columns): 

Bagnumber | Length before | Length after | Placement of cut 1 | Amount of cut 1
| Placement of cut 2 | Amount of cut 2 | Placement of cut 3 | Amount of cut 3
| Placement of cut 4 | Amount of cut 4 | 

This is slightly diffferent than stated in the none-digital cutting sheets, 
however this was done in order to simplify the process of setting in breaks. 

The process was repeated for each run from the EGRIP gas campaign 2023.
